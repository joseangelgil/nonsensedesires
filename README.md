## 🎯 Description

This project was built **from scratch** as part of my personal learning journey in software development.  
It helped me strengthen my skills in:

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Component-based UI design

**NonSenseDesireS** is a parody e-commerce landing page that showcases ridiculous products nobody needs — but you might still want.

## 🧪 Features

- A selection of completely **useless yet oddly tempting products**
- Add items to the **shopping cart**
- Interact with two main actions:
  - **Clear**: Empties the cart
  - **Proceed to Payment**: Triggers a humorous message questioning your life choices

This page is meant for fun and experimentation — no real purchases involved 😉

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla + JSX)
- Vite

---

## ⚠️ Requirements
